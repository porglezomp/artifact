Specifications for the artifact cmdline interface
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls]
text = '''
The `art ls` command shall be used to list information the artifacts in a
project.

`ls` is the primary window into a user's artifacts, creating a simple
interface to glimpse large amounts of information.

## Arguments
`art ls` with no commands given will simply print all artifacts with standard
settings in a single line of information.

The args are as follows:
 - SEARCH str: positional argument detailing which artifacts to display
    By default, this will be interpreted as an ArtName group. However, if pattern
    searching is selected, it will be interpreted as a rust regexp
 - display: flags that control what information will be displayed
 - pattern: flag which controls which fields will be searched when
     regex pattern is selected
 - completed/tested: flags which control what percentage completed/tested to
     display
 - type: this allows exporting artifacts in machine readable formats like json
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls-color]
text = '''
In order to make viewing of information via cmdline easier,
artifact **shall** colorize it's output to make it clear which items
are done or not done or in error.

The following **will** be followed:
- names that are complete will be green
- names that are almost complete will be blue
- names that are somewhat complete will be yellow
- names that are very litle or not complete will be red
- names that are in ERROR will *blink bold red*

For completed, the levels are: (100%, 70%, 40%, 0%) which correspond to points
(3, 2, 1, 0) and colors (blue, yellow, yellow, red)

For tested, the levels are: (100%, 50%, 0%) which correspond to points (2, 1, 0)
and colors (blue, yellow, red)

Add these together and you get the following:
- 5: Everything green
- 3-4: name is blue
- 1-2: name is yellow
- 0: name is red
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls-display]
text = '''
The following flags are used to specify what to display:
- a/A: display all these flags for all artifacts
- D: display the path to where the artifact is defined
- P: display parts names in reduced form
- O: display partof names in reduced form
- T: display the text formatted as markdown. If `-l` is not specified, this
  will display up to 50 chars of the first line of the text, truncating it
  with ... if necessary.
- L: display the loc path (implementation path)
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls-pattern]
text = '''
the `-p` flag will signify that the SEARCH argument should be interpreted as
a regexp pattern instead of as artifact names

If a value follows p, it will specify the fields to filter in that map with
REQ-ls-display (with the addition of `N` for name)

So: `art ls -p "REQ-ui-cmdline.*" -NO` would filter by name and partof
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls-type]
text = '''
The `--type` flag will allow the user to specify a different type to output
the artifacts in.

The current options are:
- list
- json

This allows other tools to build artifact.

[TST-cmd-ls]
partof = "SPC-cmd-ls-[color, display, pattern]"
text = '''
Tests for ls are relatively straightforward and mostly involve:
- having an example project
- running the ls command with various different parameters
- validating the output looks as expected
- checking that long and multi-line text is split up as it should be
